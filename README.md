# Building Area Finder
This is an Android app that helps an user to select buildings or other land areas using markers and then gives the user the coordinates and the area of the selected building along with the distance between each of the markers.

# Installing

You might wanna edit this geo-key line in the [manifest file](https://github.com/nobodyme/Buildingareafinder/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) with your own key which can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup) if the map is not visible or search isn't working

`android:value="@string/google_maps_key" />`
